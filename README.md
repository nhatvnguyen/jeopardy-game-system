Hi, welcome to the VHDL Jeopardy! This project includes a high-level block diagram, simulations using Xilinx Vivado, and the VHDL code that our team developed. In the project report, there will be a diagram showing connected VHDL modules as well as a State Machine Diagram and ASM Chart of the Game Controller made with draw.io. Thanks for checking this project out!

Team members: Nhat Nguyen, Brandon McCoy, and Tseveendorj Munkhtur
